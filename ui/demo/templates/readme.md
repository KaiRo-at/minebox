/templates folder aims to contain the small pieces of required code to display widgets on dashboard and popups in other views such as backups or contracts.
Within the html files there must only be html code. For JS and CSS you may create corresponding file (widget-disks.html -> widget.disks.js / widget.disks.css) and save it on the proper CSS folder
